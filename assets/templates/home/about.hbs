		 <h3>For curious, creators , adventurers.</h3>
		 <p><a>UrbanTimelapse.com</a> is aimed to fulfill one's desire to get a feel for the city they are traveling to or their friends are from. It is a very unique and natural way to discover urban environments around our planet behind a screen.	</p> 
		<p>The Idea popped up  the moment Alexey  (founder) finished the timelapse video of his hometown (above) he randomly stumbled upon:</p>

		<p>"Seeing my city through the lens of timelapse photography felt mind blowing, hundreds of memories were brought up instantly. I discovered  the best way to tell where I from to people I meet around the globe.</p>
		<p>Digging deeper there's enormous community consisting of pure enthusiasm and talent behind the videos.  There's a wonderful chance to bring curious and creators together in one place and I'd like to give it a shot."</p> 
		<p>UrbanTimelapse lives in Prague currently since Alexey and his wife Marina relocated there recently. It heavily depends on support of good friends in San Francisco - without whom it would not be alive, thank you Andrew Shatnyy, Michael Makarov and Vasiliy Myazin!</p>
		<p>And thank you Amit Bijlani and <a>teamtreehouse.com</a> for kick staring the project.</p>
